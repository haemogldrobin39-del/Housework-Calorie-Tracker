# Household Work Calorie Calculator

I created this project to help my mother and support my family as part of an attachment program in my course. The goal of this tool is to allow her (and others) to **track the calories burned during household chores**.

Unlike other online tools, this website **does not automatically calculate calorie values**. Instead, it allows users to **tick off the tasks they’ve completed**, making it simple, interactive, and easy to use.

This approach encourages moms to realize that **even just doing household activities can help maintain a level of fitness**, so they don’t feel discouraged if they’re unable to do other forms of exercise.

By using this tool, moms can stay mindful of their daily activity and, over time, feel motivated to maintain a healthier lifestyle, even while managing their household responsibilities.
